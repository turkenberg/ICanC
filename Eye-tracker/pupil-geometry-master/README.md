# Pupil Hardware

We release the CAD files for the camera mounts for you to download and modify, in accordance with our license. CAD files for the frame are not open source, but we do document the interface for the DIY Kit and Pupil Headset.

## Interface Documentation

By releasing the mounts as example geometry we automatically document the interface. You can use the CAD files to take measurements and make your own mounts. Note, that the tolerances may need to be changed for your material or fabrication process.
